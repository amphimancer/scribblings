I take a shower, dry my hair, do a little make-up – but not too much because it's technically against the rules. I then go to school. Just like everyone else. There is safety in normalcy.","category":"page"},{"location":"content/2025/april/4/","page":"Magic Is Outside the Norm","title":"Magic Is Outside the Norm","text":"That said, I have a secret. Something that only my family knows and I am never, ever allowed to speak about publicly. My grandfather was a magician. He's been in jail for as long as I can remember. I have spoken to him a few times, but I know better than to listen too deeply. After all, I don't want to be lead astray. There's safety in normalcy.","category":"page"},{"location":"content/2025/april/4/","page":"Magic Is Outside the Norm","title":"Magic Is Outside the Norm","text":"There was a day not too long ago when I found myself next to a river. I was just skipping stones with a few friends and passing time. You know, normal kid stuff.","category":"page"},{"location":"content/2025/april/4/","page":"Magic Is Outside the Norm","title":"Magic Is Outside the Norm","text":"But then I saw something glittering amidst the rocks in the river and waded in to pick it up. It was a small black pen which was very clearly out of ink. There was a certain feeling I got when holding it in my hand. I can't fully describe it. It was like I was meant to hold it in a way. I knew I couldn't just leave it, so I brought it home, telling myself that I would figure out how to recycle it later.","category":"page"},{"location":"content/2025/april/4/","page":"Magic Is Outside the Norm","title":"Magic Is Outside the Norm","text":"There's safety in normalcy, and I don't think anything I did that day was abnormal","category":"page"},{"location":"content/2025/april/4/","page":"Magic Is Outside the Norm","title":"Magic Is Outside the Norm","text":"When doing homework later that evening, my normal pen ran out of ink, so I dug dug into my drawer and pulled out the one I fetched from the river earlier.  I knew it was empty, but without thinking anything too deep, I tried to write with it anyway. Surprisingly, it worked, and produced a small trail of jet-black ink, but I did notice something odd. Every time I looped certain characters, like for \"o\"'s and \"a\"'s, I saw a small flash of light coming from the page. At the time, I didn't think this was abnormal. I just thought my eyes were just playing tricks on me, so I continued to finish my homework as usual.","category":"page"},{"location":"content/2025/april/4/","page":"Magic Is Outside the Norm","title":"Magic Is Outside the Norm","text":"I turned it in the next day. I got a C. Everything was as it normally was, and there is safety in normalcy.","category":"page"},{"location":"content/2025/april/4/","page":"Magic Is Outside the Norm","title":"Magic Is Outside the Norm","text":"But during the day, I couldn't stop thinking about the flashes of light I saw the night before. When I went home, I took out the pen and fresh page of paper. I then took a second to think about what I was about to do, and felt my heart racing a little for a reason I couldn't quite explain. I then put the pen to the page and drew a large circle. When I completed it, I was shocked by a huge flash of light and fell off my chair.","category":"page"},{"location":"content/2025/april/4/","page":"Magic Is Outside the Norm","title":"Magic Is Outside the Norm","text":"I knew in that moment what I had done. It something I knew was abnormal. Something I knew I should not have done. Magic.","category":"page"},{"location":"content/2025/april/4/","page":"Magic Is Outside the Norm","title":"Magic Is Outside the Norm","text":"In the following few weeks, I would spend a few hours a day drawing different things, circling them, and seeing them come to life.  I found a few rules to follow and ultimately started to learn how to draw magic circles. Every day, I was incredibly excited to go home and practice a little more. In my excitement, I found myself doing a number of abnormal things. I wouldn't do homework. I would stay up a little too late. I wouldn't even hang out with friends.","category":"page"},{"location":"content/2025/april/4/","page":"Magic Is Outside the Norm","title":"Magic Is Outside the Norm","text":"Then, one day, everything came to an end. There was a knock on the door and a loud, threatening voice appeared on the other side. It said, \"Open up! This is the police. Come out with your hands up!\"","category":"page"},{"location":"content/2025/april/4/","page":"Magic Is Outside the Norm","title":"Magic Is Outside the Norm","text":"I did as I was told and was placed in handcuffs. The officer said, \"You're under arrest for irresponsible and underage magic usage. Anything you say can and will be used against you in court.\" Through the window, I then saw another officer rummaging through my room, trying to figure out what kind of magic I was using and how I was casting spells.","category":"page"},{"location":"content/2025/april/4/","page":"Magic Is Outside the Norm","title":"Magic Is Outside the Norm","text":"I went with them willingly. After all, there is safety in normalcy, and I was abnormal.","category":"page"},{"location":"content/2025/april/4/","page":"Magic Is Outside the Norm","title":"Magic Is Outside the Norm","text":"","category":"page"},{"location":"content/2025/april/4/","page":"Magic Is Outside the Norm","title":"Magic Is Outside the Norm","text":"Prompt: You always thought your wizarding life would begin with something like \"yer a wizard, Harry.\" You never expected it to actually start with \"you're under arrest for irresponsible and underage magic usage.\"","category":"page"},{"location":"content/2025/april/8/#The-Amphimancer:-Not-Alone","page":"The Amphimancer: Not Alone","title":"The Amphimancer: Not Alone","text":"","category":"section"},{"location":"content/2025/april/8/","page":"The Amphimancer: Not Alone","title":"The Amphimancer: Not Alone","text":"I found myself alone in the middle of a dark alley, using some soft trash bags as cushion to sleep. Some nights are hard, and that night was one of the hardest I had in a long time. I was cold. I was hungry. I couldn't sleep because there were two more unfortunate souls in the same alley who were arguing over the remains of a sandwich they found in the bin.","category":"page"},{"location":"content/2025/april/8/","page":"The Amphimancer: Not Alone","title":"The Amphimancer: Not Alone","text":"I should have left and crawled into another hole, but I didn't. I knew the men were dangerous, but not as dangerous as the police. We all knew better than to pick a real fight with each other. One wrong shout and we were all in jail. Nothing was worse than jail.","category":"page"},{"location":"content/2025/april/8/","page":"The Amphimancer: Not Alone","title":"The Amphimancer: Not Alone","text":"So I stayed and listened to the two of them bicker. At this point, they had moved off the sandwich discussion and on to finding some cardboard to sleep on. As I slowly started to doze off, I noticed something odd. A faint white mist emanating from both of them. At first, I thought nothing of it, thinking that sometimes hot heads let off steam.","category":"page"},{"location":"content/2025/april/8/","page":"The Amphimancer: Not Alone","title":"The Amphimancer: Not Alone","text":"Over time, the mist began to grow, eventually obscuring the two of them completely. At this point, I thought they would stop fighting for at least a brief moment to acknowledge the situation at hand. But they didn't. So I kept watching and listening.","category":"page"},{"location":"content/2025/april/8/","page":"The Amphimancer: Not Alone","title":"The Amphimancer: Not Alone","text":"Soon, the mist began to solidify and became a strange goop that covered them both and quivered to their emotions. Importantly, there was a thin line connecting the two goopy cocoons. Whenever the argument got heated, the thread would shimmer and glow a bright red. As they cooled down, so did the conduit.","category":"page"},{"location":"content/2025/april/8/","page":"The Amphimancer: Not Alone","title":"The Amphimancer: Not Alone","text":"In that moment, I must have fallen asleep. I had a dream that the rest of the world was gone. It was just the three of us in an eternal, black abyss. I had no idea what we were standing on, but the two men were still going at it.","category":"page"},{"location":"content/2025/april/8/","page":"The Amphimancer: Not Alone","title":"The Amphimancer: Not Alone","text":"I sighed, waving my palm towards them and said, \"Enough. Some of us are trying to sleep.\" In that moment, I noticed a golden chord extending from my arm and attaching to the connection between the two of them. The color turned from red to white and they topped fighting altogether.","category":"page"},{"location":"content/2025/april/8/","page":"The Amphimancer: Not Alone","title":"The Amphimancer: Not Alone","text":"I then heard a loud rumble of thunder and grumbled to myself, worrying about the weather. I didn't have any sort of protection from the rain. But, seeing as I was still dreaming in the black void, I couldn't find shelter even if I wanted to.","category":"page"},{"location":"content/2025/april/8/","page":"The Amphimancer: Not Alone","title":"The Amphimancer: Not Alone","text":"There was another rumble. This time, it really felt like someone was calling my name. Another rumble. This time, I was sure of it. It clearly said, \"Anna...\" and then something I couldn't make out.","category":"page"},{"location":"content/2025/april/8/","page":"The Amphimancer: Not Alone","title":"The Amphimancer: Not Alone","text":"At this point, the two others had left the void and I was alone, laying on cushion I couldn't see. There was another rumble, \"Anna. You have awoken. You are the first amphimancer – one who controls the synergistic connections between things. Use your power wisely.\"","category":"page"},{"location":"content/2025/april/8/","page":"The Amphimancer: Not Alone","title":"The Amphimancer: Not Alone","text":"That was the end of my dream. The next morning, I woke up to the two men apologizing to me for the night before, saying that my outburst really helped them find some perspective.","category":"page"},{"location":"content/2025/april/8/","page":"The Amphimancer: Not Alone","title":"The Amphimancer: Not Alone","text":"Later that day, while rummaging through some garbage, I saw a black kitten next to me. I decided to give it a half-eaten can of tuna I had found. When I did so, I noticed the white mist from the night before around the cat and a small strand connecting it back to me.","category":"page"},{"location":"content/2025/april/8/","page":"The Amphimancer: Not Alone","title":"The Amphimancer: Not Alone","text":"It was then that I realized what I was seeing. The souls of everything and everyone and, importantly, how they connected to one another. By feeding the cat, I had befriended it, thus connecting the two of us.","category":"page"},{"location":"content/2025/april/8/","page":"The Amphimancer: Not Alone","title":"The Amphimancer: Not Alone","text":"Over time, I learned how to control the power and began to see more connections between people and things. I was able to more easily get food, to break up fights, and to live a comfortable life. After taking care of myself, I realized I could start taking care of other people as well.","category":"page"},{"location":"content/2025/april/8/","page":"The Amphimancer: Not Alone","title":"The Amphimancer: Not Alone","text":"One evening, I donned a hood and strolled about town, watching the people around me. I was able to find parents and children. To mediate relationships. To be a good person. As someone who lived their entire life in the shadows as a powerless nobody, it felt good to help others.","category":"page"},{"location":"content/2025/april/8/","page":"The Amphimancer: Not Alone","title":"The Amphimancer: Not Alone","text":"One day, while doing my nightly patrol, I saw a thin black chord connected to my back and extending into a dark alleyway. I paused for a moment, trying to figure out what it was. At that point, I knew enough about my powers to know that the thread was definitely connecting me to another human, but I had never seen a thread of that color before. I had an unsettling feeling in my gut that I definitely did not want to see whoever was on the other side of that cord.","category":"page"},{"location":"content/2025/april/8/","page":"The Amphimancer: Not Alone","title":"The Amphimancer: Not Alone","text":"So I ran. I ran as fast and as far as I could, using every bit of knowledge I had from living in the undercity for so long. Yet. No matter how hard I tried, the cord followed me. The person managed to pursue me perfectly.","category":"page"},{"location":"content/2025/april/8/","page":"The Amphimancer: Not Alone","title":"The Amphimancer: Not Alone","text":"Frantically, I started taking random turns, hoping to throw them off until I took one path I knew I shouldn't have. Before even reaching the end of the road, I knew my mistake, but I ran anyway, hoping there would be some way out of the situation. There wasn't. I hit a dead end.","category":"page"},{"location":"content/2025/april/8/","page":"The Amphimancer: Not Alone","title":"The Amphimancer: Not Alone","text":"I faced the wall. Defeated. Feeling the person inching closer and closer.","category":"page"},{"location":"content/2025/april/8/","page":"The Amphimancer: Not Alone","title":"The Amphimancer: Not Alone","text":"I curled up into a ball and in a few seconds, I felt a rough hand on my shoulder. An unwashed breath then whispered into my ear, \"With how much the Gods like you, I thought you'd be something special. You're really disappointing, though. Just a shy little doll who can't do anything without someone pulling her strings. I wonder why those divine fools would put all their hopes in a pathetic weakling like you.\"","category":"page"},{"location":"content/2025/april/8/","page":"The Amphimancer: Not Alone","title":"The Amphimancer: Not Alone","text":"I was back in the void. The man was gone.","category":"page"},{"location":"content/2025/april/8/","page":"The Amphimancer: Not Alone","title":"The Amphimancer: Not Alone","text":"At first, I sighed in relief. But then I looked down and saw a purple thread extending from my stomach and into the darkness. It felt like a small insect crawling around my body. I then saw a yellow one connected to my left arm. Then a blue one connected to my right. Soon, I saw hundreds of different threads, all extending far into the nothingness.","category":"page"},{"location":"content/2025/april/8/","page":"The Amphimancer: Not Alone","title":"The Amphimancer: Not Alone","text":"I was not alone. And that was terrifying.","category":"page"},{"location":"content/2025/april/8/","page":"The Amphimancer: Not Alone","title":"The Amphimancer: Not Alone","text":"","category":"page"},{"location":"content/2025/april/8/","page":"The Amphimancer: Not Alone","title":"The Amphimancer: Not Alone","text":"Prompt: \"With how much the Gods like you, I thought you'd be something special.

Sorry. Let me correct myself. I ran into like five different doorways today.","category":"page"},{"location":"content/2025/may/7/","page":"There's Something in the Water","title":"There's Something in the Water","text":"At school. At home. In the bathroom. Everywhere.","category":"page"},{"location":"content/2025/may/7/","page":"There's Something in the Water","title":"There's Something in the Water","text":"My shoulders are just super wide. No. That's not right. They are statistically average for my height and even somewhat slim considering my weight. Still, I just don't fit.","category":"page"},{"location":"content/2025/may/7/","page":"There's Something in the Water","title":"There's Something in the Water","text":"It's not just doorways.

No matter how hard I try, I don't mix.","category":"page"},{"location":"content/2025/may/7/","page":"There's Something in the Water","title":"There's Something in the Water","text":"I live on a somewhat populated but small island off the coast of Japan. Some nights I'll make my way down to the beach and wade in the darkness. It's calming.","category":"page"},{"location":"content/2025/may/7/","page":"There's Something in the Water","title":"There's Something in the Water","text":"One night, after a particularly tough day, I put on a swim suit before going out and just sat on the water's edge, feeling the water rush between my toes and on my legs. I watched the stars for a little too long and woke up a few hours later, curled into a ball on the sand. I took a breath, trying to muster the energy to get up and wander back home with sand covering every millimeter of my body.","category":"page"},{"location":"content/2025/may/7/","page":"There's Something in the Water","title":"There's Something in the Water","text":"Then, in the moonlight, I saw something odd: an orb of sea water sitting in front of me without mixing with the sand. My first thought was that it was some sort of jellyfish, but that couldn't be the case. The area had a net and a reef protecting us from those sorts of creatures.","category":"page"},{"location":"content/2025/may/7/","page":"There's Something in the Water","title":"There's Something in the Water","text":"Without thinking too much, I tried talking to it. \"Hello?

Luckily, I didn't miss much.","category":"page"},{"location":"content/2025/may/7/","page":"There's Something in the Water","title":"There's Something in the Water","text":"The next night, I was on the beach again in my swim suit and on the edge of the water.
