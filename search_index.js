I take a shower, dry my hair, do a little make-up – but not too much because it's technically against the rules. I then go to school. Just like everyone else. There is safety in normalcy.","category":"page"},{"location":"content/2025/april/4/","page":"Magic is Outside the Norm","title":"Magic is Outside the Norm","text":"That said, I have a secret. Something that only my family knows and I am never, ever allowed to speak about publicly. My grandfather was a magician. He's been in jail for as long as I can remember. I have spoken to him a few times, but I know better than to listen too deeply. After all, I don't want to be lead astray. There's safety in normalcy.","category":"page"},{"location":"content/2025/april/4/","page":"Magic is Outside the Norm","title":"Magic is Outside the Norm","text":"There was a day not too long ago when I found myself next to a river. I was just skipping stones with a few friends and passing time. You know, normal kid stuff.","category":"page"},{"location":"content/2025/april/4/","page":"Magic is Outside the Norm","title":"Magic is Outside the Norm","text":"But then I saw something glittering amidst the rocks in the river and waded in to pick it up. It was a small black pen which was very clearly out of ink. There was a certain feeling I got when holding it in my hand. I can't fully describe it. It was like I was meant to hold it in a way. I knew I couldn't just leave it, so I brought it home, telling myself that I would figure out how to recycle it later.","category":"page"},{"location":"content/2025/april/4/","page":"Magic is Outside the Norm","title":"Magic is Outside the Norm","text":"There's safety in normalcy, and I don't think anything I did that day was abnormal","category":"page"},{"location":"content/2025/april/4/","page":"Magic is Outside the Norm","title":"Magic is Outside the Norm","text":"When doing homework later that evening, my normal pen ran out of ink, so I dug dug into my drawer and pulled out the one I fetched from the river earlier.  I knew it was empty, but without thinking anything too deep, I tried to write with it anyway. Surprisingly, it worked, and produced a small trail of jet-black ink, but I did notice something odd. Every time I looped certain characters, like for \"o\"'s and \"a\"'s, I saw a small flash of light coming from the page. At the time, I didn't think this was abnormal. I just thought my eyes were just playing tricks on me, so I continued to finish my homework as usual.","category":"page"},{"location":"content/2025/april/4/","page":"Magic is Outside the Norm","title":"Magic is Outside the Norm","text":"I turned it in the next day. I got a C. Everything was as it normally was, and there is safety in normalcy.","category":"page"},{"location":"content/2025/april/4/","page":"Magic is Outside the Norm","title":"Magic is Outside the Norm","text":"But during the day, I couldn't stop thinking about the flashes of light I saw the night before. When I went home, I took out the pen and fresh page of paper. I then took a second to think about what I was about to do, and felt my heart racing a little for a reason I couldn't quite explain. I then put the pen to the page and drew a large circle. When I completed it, I was shocked by a huge flash of light and fell off my chair.","category":"page"},{"location":"content/2025/april/4/","page":"Magic is Outside the Norm","title":"Magic is Outside the Norm","text":"I knew in that moment what I had done. It something I knew was abnormal. Something I knew I should not have done. Magic.","category":"page"},{"location":"content/2025/april/4/","page":"Magic is Outside the Norm","title":"Magic is Outside the Norm","text":"In the following few weeks, I would spend a few hours a day drawing different things, circling them, and seeing them come to life.  I found a few rules to follow and ultimately started to learn how to draw magic circles. Every day, I was incredibly excited to go home and practice a little more. In my excitement, I found myself doing a number of abnormal things. I wouldn't do homework. I would stay up a little too late. I wouldn't even hang out with friends.","category":"page"},{"location":"content/2025/april/4/","page":"Magic is Outside the Norm","title":"Magic is Outside the Norm","text":"Then, one day, everything came to an end. There was a knock on the door and a loud, threatening voice appeared on the other side. It said, \"Open up! This is the police. Come out with your hands up!\"","category":"page"},{"location":"content/2025/april/4/","page":"Magic is Outside the Norm","title":"Magic is Outside the Norm","text":"I did as I was told and was placed in handcuffs. The officer said, \"You're under arrest for irresponsible and underage magic usage. Anything you say can and will be used against you in court.\" Through the window, I then saw another officer rummaging through my room, trying to figure out what kind of magic I was using and how I was casting spells.","category":"page"},{"location":"content/2025/april/4/","page":"Magic is Outside the Norm","title":"Magic is Outside the Norm","text":"I went with them willingly. After all, there is safety in normalcy, and I was abnormal.","category":"page"},{"location":"content/2025/april/4/","page":"Magic is Outside the Norm","title":"Magic is Outside the Norm","text":"","category":"page"},{"location":"content/2025/april/4/","page":"Magic is Outside the Norm","title":"Magic is Outside the Norm","text":"Prompt: You always thought your wizarding life would begin with something like \"yer a wizard, Harry.\" You never expected it to actually start with \"you're under arrest for irresponsible and underage magic usage.\"","category":"page"},{"location":"content/2025/april/8/#The-Amphimancer:-Not-Alone","page":"The Amphimancer: Not Alone","title":"The Amphimancer: Not Alone","text":"","category":"section"},{"location":"content/2025/april/8/","page":"The Amphimancer: Not Alone","title":"The Amphimancer: Not Alone","text":"I found myself alone in the middle of a dark alley, using some soft trash bags as cushion to sleep. Some nights are hard, and that night was one of the hardest I had in a long time. I was cold. I was hungry. I couldn't sleep because there were two more unfortunate souls in the same alley who were arguing over the remains of a sandwich they found in the bin.","category":"page"},{"location":"content/2025/april/8/","page":"The Amphimancer: Not Alone","title":"The Amphimancer: Not Alone","text":"I should have left and crawled into another hole, but I didn't. I knew the men were dangerous, but not as dangerous as the police. We all knew better than to pick a real fight with each other. One wrong shout and we were all in jail. Nothing was worse than jail.","category":"page"},{"location":"content/2025/april/8/","page":"The Amphimancer: Not Alone","title":"The Amphimancer: Not Alone","text":"So I stayed and listened to the two of them bicker. At this point, they had moved off the sandwich discussion and on to finding some cardboard to sleep on. As I slowly started to doze off, I noticed something odd. A faint white mist emanating from both of them. At first, I thought nothing of it, thinking that sometimes hot heads let off steam.","category":"page"},{"location":"content/2025/april/8/","page":"The Amphimancer: Not Alone","title":"The Amphimancer: Not Alone","text":"Over time, the mist began to grow, eventually obscuring the two of them completely. At this point, I thought they would stop fighting for at least a brief moment to acknowledge the situation at hand. But they didn't. So I kept watching and listening.","category":"page"},{"location":"content/2025/april/8/","page":"The Amphimancer: Not Alone","title":"The Amphimancer: Not Alone","text":"Soon, the mist began to solidify and became a strange goop that covered them both and quivered to their emotions. Importantly, there was a thin line connecting the two goopy cocoons. Whenever the argument got heated, the thread would shimmer and glow a bright red. As they cooled down, so did the conduit.","category":"page"},{"location":"content/2025/april/8/","page":"The Amphimancer: Not Alone","title":"The Amphimancer: Not Alone","text":"In that moment, I must have fallen asleep. I had a dream that the rest of the world was gone. It was just the three of us in an eternal, black abyss. I had no idea what we were standing on, but the two men were still going at it.","category":"page"},{"location":"content/2025/april/8/","page":"The Amphimancer: Not Alone","title":"The Amphimancer: Not Alone","text":"I sighed, waving my palm towards them and said, \"Enough. Some of us are trying to sleep.\" In that moment, I noticed a golden chord extending from my arm and attaching to the connection between the two of them. The color turned from red to white and they topped fighting altogether.","category":"page"},{"location":"content/2025/april/8/","page":"The Amphimancer: Not Alone","title":"The Amphimancer: Not Alone","text":"I then heard a loud rumble of thunder and grumbled to myself, worrying about the weather. I didn't have any sort of protection from the rain. But, seeing as I was still dreaming in the black void, I couldn't find shelter even if I wanted to.","category":"page"},{"location":"content/2025/april/8/","page":"The Amphimancer: Not Alone","title":"The Amphimancer: Not Alone","text":"There was another rumble. This time, it really felt like someone was calling my name. Another rumble. This time, I was sure of it. It clearly said, \"Anna...\" and then something I couldn't make out.","category":"page"},{"location":"content/2025/april/8/","page":"The Amphimancer: Not Alone","title":"The Amphimancer: Not Alone","text":"At this point, the two others had left the void and I was alone, laying on cushion I couldn't see. There was another rumble, \"Anna. You have awoken. You are the first amphimancer – one who controls the synergistic connections between things. Use your power wisely.\"","category":"page"},{"location":"content/2025/april/8/","page":"The Amphimancer: Not Alone","title":"The Amphimancer: Not Alone","text":"That was the end of my dream. The next morning, I woke up to the two men apologizing to me for the night before, saying that my outburst really helped them find some perspective.","category":"page"},{"location":"content/2025/april/8/","page":"The Amphimancer: Not Alone","title":"The Amphimancer: Not Alone","text":"Later that day, while rummaging through some garbage, I saw a black kitten next to me. I decided to give it a half-eaten can of tuna I had found. When I did so, I noticed the white mist from the night before around the cat and a small strand connecting it back to me.","category":"page"},{"location":"content/2025/april/8/","page":"The Amphimancer: Not Alone","title":"The Amphimancer: Not Alone","text":"It was then that I realized what I was seeing. The souls of everything and everyone and, importantly, how they connected to one another. By feeding the cat, I had befriended it, thus connecting the two of us.","category":"page"},{"location":"content/2025/april/8/","page":"The Amphimancer: Not Alone","title":"The Amphimancer: Not Alone","text":"Over time, I learned how to control the power and began to see more connections between people and things. I was able to more easily get food, to break up fights, and to live a comfortable life. After taking care of myself, I realized I could start taking care of other people as well.","category":"page"},{"location":"content/2025/april/8/","page":"The Amphimancer: Not Alone","title":"The Amphimancer: Not Alone","text":"One evening, I donned a hood and strolled about town, watching the people around me. I was able to find parents and children. To mediate relationships. To be a good person. As someone who lived their entire life in the shadows as a powerless nobody, it felt good to help others.","category":"page"},{"location":"content/2025/april/8/","page":"The Amphimancer: Not Alone","title":"The Amphimancer: Not Alone","text":"One day, while doing my nightly patrol, I saw a thin black chord connected to my back and extending into a dark alleyway. I paused for a moment, trying to figure out what it was. At that point, I knew enough about my powers to know that the thread was definitely connecting me to another human, but I had never seen a thread of that color before. I had an unsettling feeling in my gut that I definitely did not want to see whoever was on the other side of that cord.","category":"page"},{"location":"content/2025/april/8/","page":"The Amphimancer: Not Alone","title":"The Amphimancer: Not Alone","text":"So I ran. I ran as fast and as far as I could, using every bit of knowledge I had from living in the undercity for so long. Yet. No matter how hard I tried, the cord followed me. The person managed to pursue me perfectly.","category":"page"},{"location":"content/2025/april/8/","page":"The Amphimancer: Not Alone","title":"The Amphimancer: Not Alone","text":"Frantically, I started taking random turns, hoping to throw them off until I took one path I knew I shouldn't have. Before even reaching the end of the road, I knew my mistake, but I ran anyway, hoping there would be some way out of the situation. There wasn't. I hit a dead end.","category":"page"},{"location":"content/2025/april/8/","page":"The Amphimancer: Not Alone","title":"The Amphimancer: Not Alone","text":"I faced the wall. Defeated. Feeling the person inching closer and closer.","category":"page"},{"location":"content/2025/april/8/","page":"The Amphimancer: Not Alone","title":"The Amphimancer: Not Alone","text":"I curled up into a ball and in a few seconds, I felt a rough hand on my shoulder. An unwashed breath then whispered into my ear, \"With how much the Gods like you, I thought you'd be something special. You're really disappointing, though. Just a shy little doll who can't do anything without someone pulling her strings. I wonder why those divine fools would put all their hopes in a pathetic weakling like you.\"","category":"page"},{"location":"content/2025/april/8/","page":"The Amphimancer: Not Alone","title":"The Amphimancer: Not Alone","text":"I was back in the void. The man was gone.","category":"page"},{"location":"content/2025/april/8/","page":"The Amphimancer: Not Alone","title":"The Amphimancer: Not Alone","text":"At first, I sighed in relief. But then I looked down and saw a purple thread extending from my stomach and into the darkness. It felt like a small insect crawling around my body. I then saw a yellow one connected to my left arm. Then a blue one connected to my right. Soon, I saw hundreds of different threads, all extending far into the nothingness.","category":"page"},{"location":"content/2025/april/8/","page":"The Amphimancer: Not Alone","title":"The Amphimancer: Not Alone","text":"I was not alone. And that was terrifying.","category":"page"},{"location":"content/2025/april/8/","page":"The Amphimancer: Not Alone","title":"The Amphimancer: Not Alone","text":"","category":"page"},{"location":"content/2025/april/8/","page":"The Amphimancer: Not Alone","title":"The Amphimancer: Not Alone","text":"Prompt: \"With how much the Gods like you, I thought you'd be something special.

It was barely big enough to hold me and certainly did not provide any warmth, but given the circumstances, I wasn't picky, so I turned my back to the storm and huddled with myself for warmth.","category":"page"},{"location":"content/2025/april/7/","page":"A Walk Down Memory Lane","title":"A Walk Down Memory Lane","text":"I somehow made it through the night. With the snow settling up to my hip, it was physically impossible for me to make my way back down the mountain. I remember sitting in my little cave and wishing for so many things. I wanted more shelter. I wanted food. But most importantly, I wanted warmth. I knew I would die from hypothermia if I stayed there any longer.","category":"page"},{"location":"content/2025/april/7/","page":"A Walk Down Memory Lane","title":"A Walk Down Memory Lane","text":"I don't know why, but I found myself to be rather sleepy. Every one of my survival instincts told me that I had to stay awake, but no matter how hard I tried, I found myself drifting off. When I woke up, it was sundown. In my sleep, I had somehow picked up a small glowing crystal. At the time, I didn't know what it was. I certainly didn't expect it to change my life forever. All I knew was that it was warm and I needed warmth.","category":"page"},{"location":"content/2025/april/7/","page":"A Walk Down Memory Lane","title":"A Walk Down Memory Lane","text":"The night was harsh again, but I made it through. The next day, I realized that I needed food. I couldn't sustain myself off of ice for too much longer. As I explored the surrounding area, I found only barren trees. No fruit to eat. No animals to hunt. I was alone.","category":"page"},{"location":"content/2025/april/7/","page":"A Walk Down Memory Lane","title":"A Walk Down Memory Lane","text":"When I returned to the cave, I had an overwhelming sense of dread. I was afraid that my only source of food would be from a nearby village I could only get to after winter was over. I couldn't wait that long. I had a few days at most. ","category":"page"},{"location":"content/2025/april/7/","page":"A Walk Down Memory Lane","title":"A Walk Down Memory Lane","text":"Again, I felt sleepy. When I woke up, I found a small leaf on my chest. I didn't know where it came from, and it certainly looked poisonous, but I didn't have another options. I slowly took a bite. I was still a little hungry afterwards, but I didn't feel sick, so I knew the leaf was not poisonous at least.","category":"page"},{"location":"content/2025/april/7/","page":"A Walk Down Memory Lane","title":"A Walk Down Memory Lane","text":"After another harsh night, I woke up to a rather surprising sight. The cave felt bigger somehow. I again scoured the local surroundings for anything I could find, but found nothing. So I went back to the cave and slept, finding another leaf when I woke up.","category":"page"},{"location":"content/2025/april/7/","page":"A Walk Down Memory Lane","title":"A Walk Down Memory Lane","text":"Over time, I began to realize what the crystal was. It was a dungeon's heart, and by eating the leaf, I became the dungeon's master. Still, I couldn't complain. If I hadn't found the dungeon, I would have died.","category":"page"},{"location":"content/2025/april/7/","page":"A Walk Down Memory Lane","title":"A Walk Down Memory Lane","text":"The crystal provided food. It provided shelter. It provided warmth.","category":"page"},{"location":"content/2025/april/7/","page":"A Walk Down Memory Lane","title":"A Walk Down Memory Lane","text":"Unfortunately, it came with a drawback. I became part of the dungeon itself. If I tried to leave, I would feel weak, eventually falling asleep and waking back up in the dungeon.","category":"page"},{"location":"content/2025/april/7/","page":"A Walk Down Memory Lane","title":"A Walk Down Memory Lane","text":"Still, the crystal provided anything and everything I could need, including companions, like slimes, trolls, and orcs. I found myself naturally wanting to provide for these creatures and built a huge labyrinth in the middle of the mountain. Eventually, the labyrinth was too small, so I built multiples floors for my new friends to live in. Somehow, the bigger the dungeon was, the more powerful I felt. I could have horded that power for myself, but I found a way to distribute it among all my minions instead. This meant that even the slimes in my dungeon were nearly indestructible. After all, I really didn't want to see any of them hurt. Unfortunately, this meant that when explorers found my dungeon, they were drawn to it as a place to conquer.","category":"page"},{"location":"content/2025/april/7/","page":"A Walk Down Memory Lane","title":"A Walk Down Memory Lane","text":"For this reason, I needed to keep creating even bigger and more intelligent friends. One of them in particular was a vampire named Isabelle. She was sweet and charming and became my companion through thick and thin. Any time a minion fell sick, she was there with me to nurse them back to health. She was quick to step in and mediate any issues that might arise arise between different groups. Frankly, it was worth giving her a little blood every now and again.","category":"page"},{"location":"content/2025/april/7/","page":"A Walk Down Memory Lane","title":"A Walk Down Memory Lane","text":"Unfortunately, one day, Isabelle and I had a fight about the direction of the dungeon. She wanted to hoard manna at the bottom so she could become more powerful and protect the dungeon even better. I told her it was unnecessary because I was already distributing it to all the creatures, and they were plenty strong enough. After a heated exchange, I found myself outside of the dungeon without the heart. She had won. I lost my dungeon.","category":"page"},{"location":"content/2025/april/7/","page":"A Walk Down Memory Lane","title":"A Walk Down Memory Lane","text":"As I walked around the surrounding area, I found it to be quite different than how it was when I found the cave so many years ago. It was spring. There were fruit trees everywhere. The birds were singing. I found myself aimlessly walking towards a babbling book where I sat along the bank for a while.","category":"page"},{"location":"content/2025/april/7/","page":"A Walk Down Memory Lane","title":"A Walk Down Memory Lane","text":"I don't know exactly how long I was there, but long enough that the sun was starting to set. I then cupped some water into my hands and splashed it on to my face. Afterwards, I didn't recognize the reflection that was looking back at me.","category":"page"},{"location":"content/2025/april/7/","page":"A Walk Down Memory Lane","title":"A Walk Down Memory Lane","text":"My skin had become a dark red. I had grown horns from my forehead. My eyes were pitch black. I was a dungeon master through and through.","category":"page"},{"location":"content/2025/april/7/","page":"A Walk Down Memory Lane","title":"A Walk Down Memory Lane","text":"But I didn't have to be anymore. I could do anything. It was spring. The world was now open to me.","category":"page"},{"location":"content/2025/april/7/","page":"A Walk Down Memory Lane","title":"A Walk Down Memory Lane","text":"I stayed near my dungeon and lived off the land for the next few months. I also found a simple coat with a hood and managed to go down to the local village and get some food. It was great. I loved my newfound sense of freedom.","category":"page"},{"location":"content/2025/april/7/","page":"A Walk Down Memory Lane","title":"A Walk Down Memory Lane","text":"One day, I built up the courage to enter my dungeon once again, with the intention of working out some form of agreement with Isabelle. Unfortunately, when I entered the dungeon, it was empty. There were no slimes. No trolls. No orcs. Everyone was gone.","category":"page"},{"location":"content/2025/april/7/","page":"A Walk Down Memory Lane","title":"A Walk Down Memory Lane","text":"I made my way down to the second floor. Then the third. Then the fourth. Every floor was the same. Completely empty.","category":"page"},{"location":"content/2025/april/7/","page":"A Walk Down Memory Lane","title":"A Walk Down Memory Lane","text":"I then heard shouting coming from the basement. I rushed in to see what was going on and saw Isabelle desperately fighting against a party of four adventurers. Simply put, she was no match and eventually was defeated as well. I watched as the adventurers pulled my heart from her grasp and began celebrating their accomplishment of completely defeating the dungeon.","category":"page"},{"location":"content/2025/april/7/","page":"A Walk Down Memory Lane","title":"A Walk Down Memory Lane","text":"They then saw me lurking in shadows and pulled out their weapons once again, this time pointing them towards me. The leader asked, \"What are you doing here? Are you part of the dungeon as well?\"","category":"page"},{"location":"content/2025/april/7/","page":"A Walk Down Memory Lane","title":"A Walk Down Memory Lane","text":"To which I simply answered, \"No. I just wanted to see what the commotion was all about.\"","category":"page"},{"location":"content/2025/april/7/","page":"A Walk Down Memory Lane","title":"A Walk Down Memory Lane","text":"That seemed to satisfy them. They then left me, with each footstep as a beat my heart. I was truly alone for the first time that I could remember.","category":"page"},{"location":"content/2025/april/7/","page":"A Walk Down Memory Lane","title":"A Walk Down Memory Lane","text":"There were many emotions swirling around me at the time. Sadness for the loss of all of my friends and the destruction of everything I had built. Yet, somehow, even in that tragedy, there was hope. After all. I was now free.","category":"page"},{"location":"content/2025/april/7/","page":"A Walk Down Memory Lane","title":"A Walk Down Memory Lane","text":"","category":"page"},{"location":"content/2025/april/7/","page":"A Walk Down Memory Lane","title":"A Walk Down Memory Lane","text":"Prompt: Your party thinks you are a deadweight since they are too good to even need a healer.

Seconds turn into minutes. Minutes turn into hours. Hours turn into days. But there are certain near-universal experiences that contradict this notion.

One I felt I knew, but had never been to before. The waves. The salt in the air. The gentle current beneath my feet. It felt calming. Normal. As if the rest of my life had run away without me. I laid back, watching clouds drift across the sky. And I blinked.","category":"page"},{"location":"content/2025/march/30/","page":"Hell's Administrator","title":"Hell's Administrator","text":"It was night. The moon and the stars were out, watching me from above as I watched them from below. I tried to find a few constellations but couldn't remember any of their names. I found myself looking to my side, as if for a companion I never had. Someone to chat with until the end of time and space. Or at least until I blinked.","category":"page"},{"location":"content/2025/march/30/","page":"Hell's Administrator","title":"Hell's Administrator","text":"I was at a diner with pancakes and syrup. There was another plate in front of me with eggs and bacon. I guess whoever was eating it left. Maybe to the bathroom? Maybe we were on a date that went sour? There was a sense of loneliness that I never felt before. This person, whoever they were, was gone. And I somehow felt it was my fault.","category":"page"},{"location":"content/2025/march/30/","page":"Hell's Administrator","title":"Hell's Administrator","text":"I blinked. I was at home. A home. My home? There was a snowstorm outside. The wind was howling. The fireplace was crackling, casting long shadows on the wall. Beside the fireplace, there was a large, stagnant bucket of water. There was also an broken clock on the mantle.","category":"page"},{"location":"content/2025/march/30/","page":"Hell's Administrator","title":"Hell's Administrator","text":"I was alone on the couch with a cup of hot cocoa in hand. The wall acted as a canvas, showing an exact replica of everything in the room. The lamp. The chair. The couch. It was then that I noticed something odd. There was not one shadow sitting on the couch, but two.","category":"page"},{"location":"content/2025/march/30/","page":"Hell's Administrator","title":"Hell's Administrator","text":"In that moment, I should have felt concern. After all, that is the normal reaction to seeing the supernatural. But, like the pier before, I felt only peace. As if the shadow should be there and I was the intruder.","category":"page"},{"location":"content/2025/march/30/","page":"Hell's Administrator","title":"Hell's Administrator","text":"I blinked. There was someone on the rocking chair across from me. Not the shadow on the wall, someone else.
