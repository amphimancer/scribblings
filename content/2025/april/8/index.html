sleep. Some nights are hard, and that night was one of the hardest I had in a long time. I was cold. I was hungry. I couldn&#39;t sleep because there were two more unfortunate souls in the same alley who were arguing over the remains of a sandwich they found in the bin.</p><p>I should have left and crawled into another hole, but I didn&#39;t. I knew the men were dangerous, but not as dangerous as the police. We all knew better than to pick a real fight with each other. One wrong shout and we were all in jail. Nothing was worse than jail.</p><p>So I stayed and listened to the two of them bicker. At this point, they had moved off the sandwich discussion and on to finding some cardboard to sleep on. As I slowly started to doze off, I noticed something odd. A faint white mist emanating from both of them. At first, I thought nothing of it, thinking that sometimes hot heads let off steam.</p><p>Over time, the mist began to grow, eventually obscuring the two of them completely. At this point, I thought they would stop fighting for at least a brief moment to acknowledge the situation at hand. But they didn&#39;t. So I kept watching and listening.</p><p>Soon, the mist began to solidify and became a strange goop that covered them both and quivered to their emotions. Importantly, there was a thin line connecting the two goopy cocoons. Whenever the argument got heated, the thread would shimmer and glow a bright red. As they cooled down, so did the conduit.</p><p>In that moment, I must have fallen asleep. I had a dream that the rest of the world was gone. It was just the three of us in an eternal, black abyss. I had no idea what we were standing on, but the two men were still going at it.</p><p>I sighed, waving my palm towards them and said, &quot;Enough. Some of us are trying to sleep.&quot; In that moment, I noticed a golden chord extending from my arm and attaching to the connection between the two of them. The color turned from red to white and they topped fighting altogether.</p><p>I then heard a loud rumble of thunder and grumbled to myself, worrying about the weather. I didn&#39;t have any sort of protection from the rain. But, seeing as I was still dreaming in the black void, I couldn&#39;t find shelter even if I wanted to.</p><p>There was another rumble. This time, it really felt like someone was calling my name. Another rumble. This time, I was sure of it. It clearly said, &quot;Anna...&quot; and then something I couldn&#39;t make out.</p><p>At this point, the two others had left the void and I was alone, laying on cushion I couldn&#39;t see. There was another rumble, &quot;Anna. You have awoken. You are the first amphimancer – one who controls the synergistic connections between things. Use your power wisely.&quot;</p><p>That was the end of my dream. The next morning, I woke up to the two men apologizing to me for the night before, saying that my outburst really helped them find some perspective.</p><p>Later that day, while rummaging through some garbage, I saw a black kitten next to me. I decided to give it a half-eaten can of tuna I had found. When I did so, I noticed the white mist from the night before around the cat and a small strand connecting it back to me.</p><p>It was then that I realized what I was seeing. The souls of everything and everyone and, importantly, how they connected to one another. By feeding the cat, I had befriended it, thus connecting the two of us.</p><p>Over time, I learned how to control the power and began to see more connections between people and things. I was able to more easily get food, to break up fights, and to live a comfortable life. After taking care of myself, I realized I could start taking care of other people as well.</p><p>One evening, I donned a hood and strolled about town, watching the people around me. I was able to find parents and children. To mediate relationships. To be a good person. As someone who lived their entire life in the shadows as a powerless nobody, it felt good to help others.</p><p>One day, while doing my nightly patrol, I saw a thin black chord connected to my back and extending into a dark alleyway. I paused for a moment, trying to figure out what it was. At that point, I knew enough about my powers to know that the thread was definitely connecting me to another human, but I had never seen a thread of that color before. I had an unsettling feeling in my gut that I definitely did not want to see whoever was on the other side of that cord.</p><p>So I ran. I ran as fast and as far as I could, using every bit of knowledge I had from living in the undercity for so long. Yet. No matter how hard I tried, the cord followed me. The person managed to pursue me perfectly.</p><p>Frantically, I started taking random turns, hoping to throw them off until I took one path I knew I shouldn&#39;t have. Before even reaching the end of the road, I knew my mistake, but I ran anyway, hoping there would be some way out of the situation. There wasn&#39;t. I hit a dead end.</p><p>I faced the wall. Defeated. Feeling the person inching closer and closer.</p><p>I curled up into a ball and in a few seconds, I felt a rough hand on my shoulder. An unwashed breath then whispered into my ear, &quot;With how much the Gods like you, I thought you&#39;d be something special. You&#39;re really disappointing, though. Just a shy little doll who can&#39;t do anything without someone pulling her strings. I wonder why those divine fools would put all their hopes in a pathetic weakling like you.&quot;</p><p>I was back in the void. The man was gone.</p><p>At first, I sighed in relief. But then I looked down and saw a purple thread extending from my stomach and into the darkness. It felt like a small insect crawling around my body. I then saw a yellow one connected to my left arm. Then a blue one connected to my right. Soon, I saw hundreds of different threads, all extending far into the nothingness.</p><p>I was not alone. And that was terrifying.</p><hr/><p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/WritingPrompts/comments/1ju8t1m/wp_with_how_much_the_gods_like_you_i_thought_youd/">Prompt: &quot;With how much the Gods like you, I thought you&#39;d be something special.
