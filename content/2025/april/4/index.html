class="docs-heading-anchor-permalink" href="#Magic-is-Outside-the-Norm" title="Permalink"></a></h1><p>My alarm goes off at 6:30 every morning. I take a shower, dry my hair, do a little make-up – but not too much because it&#39;s technically against the rules. I then go to school. Just like everyone else. There is safety in normalcy.</p><p>That said, I have a secret. Something that only my family knows and I am never, ever allowed to speak about publicly. My grandfather was a magician. He&#39;s been in jail for as long as I can remember. I have spoken to him a few times, but I know better than to listen too deeply. After all, I don&#39;t want to be lead astray. There&#39;s safety in normalcy.</p><p>There was a day not too long ago when I found myself next to a river. I was just skipping stones with a few friends and passing time. You know, normal kid stuff.</p><p>But then I saw something glittering amidst the rocks in the river and waded in to pick it up. It was a small black pen which was very clearly out of ink. There was a certain feeling I got when holding it in my hand. I can&#39;t fully describe it. It was like I was <em>meant</em> to hold it in a way. I knew I couldn&#39;t just leave it, so I brought it home, telling myself that I would figure out how to recycle it later.</p><p>There&#39;s safety in normalcy, and I don&#39;t think anything I did that day was abnormal</p><p>When doing homework later that evening, my normal pen ran out of ink, so I dug dug into my drawer and pulled out the one I fetched from the river earlier.  I knew it was empty, but without thinking anything too deep, I tried to write with it anyway. Surprisingly, it worked, and produced a small trail of jet-black ink, but I did notice something odd. Every time I looped certain characters, like for &quot;o&quot;&#39;s and &quot;a&quot;&#39;s, I saw a small flash of light coming from the page. At the time, I didn&#39;t think this was abnormal. I just thought my eyes were just playing tricks on me, so I continued to finish my homework as usual.</p><p>I turned it in the next day. I got a C. Everything was as it normally was, and there is safety in normalcy.</p><p>But during the day, I couldn&#39;t stop thinking about the flashes of light I saw the night before. When I went home, I took out the pen and fresh page of paper. I then took a second to think about what I was about to do, and felt my heart racing a little for a reason I couldn&#39;t quite explain. I then put the pen to the page and drew a large circle. When I completed it, I was shocked by a huge flash of light and fell off my chair.</p><p>I knew in that moment what I had done. It something I knew was abnormal. Something I knew I should not have done. Magic.</p><p>In the following few weeks, I would spend a few hours a day drawing different things, circling them, and seeing them come to life.  I found a few rules to follow and ultimately started to learn how to draw magic circles. Every day, I was incredibly excited to go home and practice a little more. In my excitement, I found myself doing a number of abnormal things. I wouldn&#39;t do homework. I would stay up a little too late. I wouldn&#39;t even hang out with friends.</p><p>Then, one day, everything came to an end. There was a knock on the door and a loud, threatening voice appeared on the other side. It said, &quot;Open up! This is the police. Come out with your hands up!&quot;</p><p>I did as I was told and was placed in handcuffs. The officer said, &quot;You&#39;re under arrest for irresponsible and underage magic usage. Anything you say can and will be used against you in court.&quot; Through the window, I then saw another officer rummaging through my room, trying to figure out what kind of magic I was using and how I was casting spells.</p><p>I went with them willingly. After all, there is safety in normalcy, and I was abnormal.</p><hr/><p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/WritingPrompts/comments/1jr3qum/wp_you_always_thought_your_wizarding_life_would/">Prompt: You always thought your wizarding life would begin with something like &quot;yer a wizard, Harry.&quot; You never expected it to actually start with &quot;you&#39;re under arrest for irresponsible and underage magic usage.&quot;</a></p></article><nav class="docs-footer"><a class="docs-footer-prevpage" href="../7/">« A Walk Down Memory Lane</a><a class="docs-footer-nextpage" href="../2/">A Friend No More »</a><div class="flexbox-break"></div><p class="footer-message">Powered by <a href="https://github.com/JuliaDocs/Documenter.jl">Documenter.jl</a> and the <a href="https://julialang.org/">Julia Programming Language</a>.</p></nav></div><div class="modal" id="documenter-settings"><div class="modal-background"></div><div class="modal-card"><header class="modal-card-head"><p class="modal-card-title">Settings</p><button class="delete"></button></header><section class="modal-card-body"><p><label class="label">Theme</label><div class="select"><select id="documenter-themepicker"><option value="auto">Automatic (OS)</option><option value="documenter-light">documenter-light</option><option value="documenter-dark">documenter-dark</option><option value="catppuccin-latte">catppuccin-latte</option><option value="catppuccin-frappe">catppuccin-frappe</option><option value="catppuccin-macchiato">catppuccin-macchiato</option><option value="catppuccin-mocha">catppuccin-mocha</option></select></div></p><hr/><p>This document was generated with <a href="https://github.com/JuliaDocs/Documenter.jl">Documenter.jl</a> version 1.10.2 on <span class="colophon-date" title="Monday 5 May 2025 12:45">Monday 5 May 2025</span>.
