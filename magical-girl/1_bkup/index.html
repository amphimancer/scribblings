title="Permalink"></a></h1><p>Once I was out and about at midday –<br/>Absolutely normal in every way,<br/>But across a short alleyway, there was a niggle.<br/>A tendril. An arm thing? A little black wriggle.<br/>I can not describe it, except that I blinked,<br/>After that it was gone. Just completely extinct.<br/>So I sat there and thought, and I thought, and I thought.<br/>All while hoping to find some great myst&#39;ry I sought.<br/>But it never came back. Well, at least not for me.<br/>While in bed, I did think about what it could be.<br/>But eventually I became overtaken.<br/>I dreamt an odd dream. I don&#39;t think I&#39;m mistaken.</p><p>Across my small room, I saw shadows – a creature!<br/>I could not quite tell each and every feature.<br/>A man who was hunched right against the far wall?<br/>A few kids? An old lass? Someone naturally small?<br/>It began a strange dance as it flickered around,<br/>Little hops left and right without making a sound.<br/>Very soon I was frozen by unnatural fear,<br/>And became quite alarmed as the object drew near.<br/>In an instant, it vanished, becoming a smudge.<br/>I then shouted while giving my lamp a quick nudge.<br/>In the light it was gone, like the alley before.<br/>For that night I was done. I could handle no more.</p><p>So I ran down the stairs and I turned on the TV.<br/>Just hoping that shadowy thing wouldn&#39;t see me.<br/>It worked, I suppose because hours flew by.<br/>To be frank, I was scared and I thought I would cry.<br/>Soon the screen turned to static. The windows were dark.<br/>I just kept looking out toward a large local park.<br/>As I stared all too deeply right into the void.<br/>All my senses were sharpened. I felt paranoid.<br/>&quot;There is nothing. There&#39;s nothing.&quot; I said to myself,<br/>Then a figure appeared. It was next to my shelf.<br/>It was large. It was dark. It was human in form.<br/>At the time my heart stopped and my face felt quite warm.<br/>It took all of my power to hold back a scream.<br/>&quot;It&#39;s a dream.&quot; I repeated. &quot;A dream. It&#39;s a dream!&quot;</p><p>Then emboldened by logic, I took a quick stand,<br/>I approached it with small, awkward waves of my hand,<br/>But I stepped on a creak and it whipped right around.<br/>All my courage then left me and could not be found.<br/>In that moment, my body and soul seemed to split,<br/>All too strangely my eyes could not focus on it.<br/>It was faceless, opaque, with a glob for a head,<br/>It then gurgled (or howled?) while pulsing and said,<br/>&quot;Little human, you&#39;re not the right person I seek.<br/>But unfortunately, your near future is bleak.<br/>Only those with some power see me and my kin.<br/>You have no idea what kind of trouble you&#39;re in.&quot;</p><p>It then lurched and unfurled while limping at me,<br/>With new tenticles reaching like roots on a tree.<br/>In a panic, I screached all while toppling my chair,<br/>I then ran. But to where? Well, I tried not to care.<br/>Soon the floor felt like sand, and the walls were too small.<br/>I then launched for the door just beyond a short hall.<br/>I felt shortness of breath while I jiggled the knob.<br/>Everything was in silence, except my heart throb.<br/>Whether seconds or hours had passed, I lost track,<br/>But the door soon revealed a world, pitch black.<br/>No recourse. I then fled to the darkness&#39; embrace,<br/>Behind me, a deep shout, &quot;I enjoy a good race!&quot;</p><p>Ev&#39;ry step. Ev&#39;ry breath. Ev&#39;ry beat of my heart.<br/>I felt hot molten lava through my ev&#39;ry part.<br/>I was frantic, brain static. All thinking was hard,<br/>But I said to myself that I know my own yard.<br/>&quot;I&#39;ll just get to the park and then call for some help.&quot;<br/>But when looking straight forward, I let out a yelp.<br/>On the bound&#39;ry between swaying grass and night sky,<br/>I saw something odd moving that felt quite awry.<br/>At first glance, it appeared as peculiar rubble,<br/>Amorphous black goop with a weirdly shaped bubble.<br/>Again and again some more bubbles appeared.<br/>Ev&#39;ry one of them creatures. Far worse than I feared.<br/>Yet I could not retreat now, no matter the cost.<br/>For my home – no my sanctuary was now lost.<br/>As I curved through some trees, I heard something behind,<br/>From my house, a loud thunder from one of their kind:<br/>&quot;My dear brothers, don&#39;t hunt! I will have my own fun,<br/>For tonight we shall feast. You must wait &#39;till I&#39;m done!&quot;</p><p>Soon a crack and a cackle erupted around,<br/>It was cruel. A chaotic, cacophonous sound.<br/>All the shadows then vanished as if in assent.<br/>In that instant, I knew what the noise must have meant:<br/>That the creature – my creature had left me his mark.<br/>He would hunt me alone, so my future was stark.<br/>All too soon there was nothing. No voices. No light.<br/>I just had to keep running with no way to fight.<br/>There was rustling and howling with noise all around,<br/>Yet it all felt so distant, as if I had drowned.<br/>With dispair in the air, I let fear take the lead,<br/>Every movement was primal, I would not concede!<br/>*I just have to survive.** That was all I could think,<br/>So I kept clawing forward or else I would sink.</p><p>Then from deep in the forest, a whisper. A pout?<br/>It was simple and soft, yet as loud as a shout.<br/>It had caused me to jump and break out of my trance,<br/>So I swiveled while running in some sort of dance.<br/>I kept trying to locate the sound that I heard.<br/>There was no one. I thought, &quot;Look, this is absurd!<br/>Why would anyone else be around? It&#39;s so late.<br/>But then maybe this meeting means more... It is fate.&quot;</p><p>I then heard it again. A short plea so distinct,<br/>That my body leapt forward and followed instinct.<br/>I then ducked through some branches and weaved through the trees.<br/>I was still being stalked so I didn&#39;t dare freeze.<br/>Then a clearing appeared with a bench and a slide,<br/>And what looked like a figure, just sitting beside.<br/>I then paused, breathing hard. <em>What if this is a trap?</em><br/>There was no time to think, so I gave her a tap.<br/>She then leapt all while crying and crawling away,<br/>&quot;Please don&#39;t hunt me. I just want to live through the day.&quot;<br/> So I knelt down and whispered, &quot;Hey, wait. I&#39;m a friend.<br/>Please just come with me now so we don&#39;t meet our end.&quot;</p><p>She then looked right at me, her face painted in fear.<br/>She was frozen while thinking and let me draw near.<br/>It was dark at the time and I couldn&#39;t see much.<br/>There was something about her that gave me a hunch.<br/>A strange feeling I felt way deep down in my core.<br/>So I then had to ask, &quot;Have I met you before?&quot;</p><p>Though in imminent danger, the world seemed to stop.<br/>We just studied each other from bottom to top.<br/>She had eyes of deep blue and her hair was light brown,<br/>At the time, she had pursed her lips into a frown.<br/>Yet her juxtaposition was truly a sight.<br/>She appeared as an angel amid a dark night.<br/>As I looked even longer, my vision soon blurred,<br/>Like my brain turned to goo while my thoughts were all stirred.</p><p>In a flash, my head split and my body collapsed.<br/>There is no way to know how much time had elapsed.<br/>I awoke to her tear sliding down my right cheek,<br/>With my head in her lap. She said, &quot;This looks quite bleak,<br/>We&#39;ll get through this somehow. We just have to. We will.<br/>Please just calm down. Relax. We&#39;ll stay silent. Be still.&quot;</p><p>In that moment, her hand on my head and her voice...<br/>Everything felt so calming. I made a bold choice.<br/>I said, &quot;OK. Let&#39;s do this. Let&#39;s think of a plan.<br/>I will promise to do anything that I can.&quot;<br/>I then saw something odd. A faint aura? A glow?<br/>A translucent white mist that continued to grow,<br/>And then covered her body from head to her toe,<br/>Quite perplexed, I then asked, &quot;What is that? Do you know?&quot;</p><div class="admonition is-info" id="AAAA-6ceccff0dee6178b"><header class="admonition-header">AAAA<a class="admonition-anchor" href="#AAAA-6ceccff0dee6178b" title="Permalink"></a></header><div class="admonition-body"><p>Doublet doublet: Glow, grow, Toe, Know. Fix Glow and Grow if possible because they are used later</p></div></div><p>&quot;What is what?&quot; she responded, as if unaware.</p><p>I said, &quot;Maybe it&#39;s nothing&quot; and tried not to stare.<br/>But it irked me quite deeply. I started to wonder,<br/>If talking to her was a possible blunder.<br/>I didn&#39;t know her, and she didn&#39;t know me.<br/>In the end, we were strange as two strangers could be.<br/>Yet that strangeness bred closeness. I felt a connection.<br/>She pointed. No question. I followed direction.<br/>We crawled a short distance right into a playhouse,<br/>Collectively sighed, slightly sheltered from chaos.</p><p>We whispered and analyzed our situation.<br/>It wasn&#39;t too long until her short narration.<br/>&quot;It knows where we are. We can&#39;t hide. We can&#39;t fight.<br/>So to me, our best option has got to be flight.<br/>We must run and keep running as fast as we can.<br/>But it could come from anywhere. We need a plan.<br/>There is something I think we both know to be true,<br/>That we cannot get caught. It wants me. It wants you.&quot;</p><p>At that moment, we paused and both thought the same thought.<br/>Were the creatures we ran from the same? Maybe not?<br/>And if not, then just how many creatures were there?<br/>At that moment I noticed her gaze. A deep stare.<br/>It went right past my eyes and straight into my soul.<br/>All her aura extinguished and now just a coal.<br/>We could run from just one. Maybe two, but not more.<br/>Yet we knew there were many. We heard them before.<br/>So we sat there in silence both shoulder to shoulder.<br/>No plans left to plan. We got colder and colder.</p><p>The moment of respite was quickly destroyed,<br/>For from deep in the forest, a voice quite annoyed,<br/>&quot;You can&#39;t hide for much longer. I know you are here.<br/>Who is that you are with? A pair huddled in fear...<br/>It&#39;s no matter for me. Just one more for the feast.<br/>She does look to be tasty – a snack at the least!&quot;<br/>I then saw it appear from the edge of the park,<br/>An odd smudge. A long shadow. A figure, quite dark.<br/>Now distorted, opaque, and much larger in size,<br/>It was cutting through silence with gutteral cries.</p><p>So I looked toward my friend and then tugged on her hand.<br/>I said, &quot;Come with me. Right now, I need you to stand.<br/>We have no time to think. We have no time to rest.<br/>We&#39;ll get through this together. Our final grand test.&quot;</p><p>She was still and unmoving. I pulled and I pulled,<br/>But her paralyzed glare was both icy and cold.<br/>She said, &quot;Hey. There&#39;s no doubt that we&#39;re hopeless and late.<br/>Maybe now it is time to accept our grim fate.&quot;<br/>She then stared at the creature, now so very close.<br/>We could see it quite clearly, all gooey and gross.<br/>Its new body was buldging with odd extra legs,<br/>And it smelled truly awful, like old rotten eggs.<br/>As I studied it close, I saw more than before.<br/>Its translucent, dark skin showed a red glowing core.</p><p>All my thoughts seemed to scatter. I lost my own mind.<br/>I then sought an escape. Any help I could find.<br/>Yet my eyes could not focus on any one thing,<br/>Time had frozen and panic then reigned as my king.<br/>So with little recourse, I just stared at the sky.<br/>With my heart indicating the time passing by.<br/>I was drowning on shore with the waves hitting me,<br/>So I offered the heavens a desperate plea:<br/>&quot;To a god or a goddess who&#39;s up there right now,<br/>We could really use help in some way or somehow.<br/>I don&#39;t know what we want – What we need at our core.<br/>For it might be a miracle... Or something more!<br/>If you hear me right now, please just send us your best,<br/>Maybe give me a plan and I&#39;ll do all the rest!&quot;</p><p>There are bound&#39;ries where subjective, objective smear,<br/>Where fantastical facts and good stories appear.<br/>It was there that I think that our story began.<br/>As a promise to no one to do what we can.</p><p>The next moment, I saw a star shimmer and glow.<br/>It just rocked back and forth before starting to grow.<br/>It then pulsed a bright blue and popped with a sound.<br/>A lone note in the emptiness, echoing &#39;round.<br/>In a chain reaction, there were more stars to burst.<br/>Ev&#39;ry one with a vibrant display, like the first.<br/>Pretty soon there was no light. The sky was pitch black.<br/>We saw only our creature&#39;s dim, red glowing sack.</p><p>It had stopped in the darkness while watching and curious,<br/>Its miserable core both impatient and furious.<br/>It felt like a cat watching prey get away.<br/>Or a shark smelling blood, watching dinner decay.<br/>Under cover of darkness, I checked on my friend.<br/>Even then, she was whispering, &quot;This is the end.&quot;<br/>In that moment, I felt something deep in my soul.<br/>That my hope to survive was alive – a small coal.<br/>I could save myself only. My partner was stone.<br/>In the void I could run and escape all alone,<br/>Yet my heart knew the truth. That there wasn&#39;t a choice.<br/>I then squeezed her hand tightly while raising my voice,<br/>&quot;We are in this together. I&#39;ll die by your side.&quot;<br/>Then my coal was snuffed out while we silently cried.</p><p>The faint light from the creature – now all we could see,<br/>Though once chained to the earth was released and set free.<br/>The false idol stepped forward, and as it did so,<br/>A red shockwave then set the void briefly aglow.<br/>A new step. A new gust. A new wave on the sand,<br/>We felt pressure now building we could not withstand.<br/>Something new then appeared. A faint light from behind.<br/>From the heart of my friend that each pulse then refined.</p><div class="admonition is-info" id="What&#39;s-left-5a56710edaf23976"><header class="admonition-header">What&#39;s left<a class="admonition-anchor" href="#What&#39;s-left-5a56710edaf23976" title="Permalink"></a></header><div class="admonition-body"><ol><li>Anne is going to develop powers</li><li>Belle will accidentally steal the powers</li><li>They run</li></ol></div></div><p>Soon the mist then reformed into a cacoon</p><p>The mist had grown so impressively bright.<br/>She was the most intense of all the light.</p><p>Seeing this, the creature stepped back, quite meek,<br/>&quot;That&#39;s her!&quot; It growled, &quot;The person I seek!<br/>She has awoken! Brothers, let us fight!<br/>I swear we&#39;ll be victorious this night!&quot;</p><p>The cries from the forest returned, quite loud,<br/>Shadow after shadow became a crowd.<br/>We were surrounded with nowhere to go,<br/>I had nothing. We had reached a new low.<br/>Just one of the creatures would be too much,<br/>Yet here there were dozens, hundreds as such!<br/>Frantic, confused, I lost all of my hope.<br/>I curled myself on the ground to cope.<br/>My friend was silent in her bright cacoon.<br/>Everything was bleak. They would attack soon.</p><p>My mind kept buzzing. Turning and turning.<br/>There was a thought. A little concerning,<br/>&quot;These creatures are strong. Much stronger than us.<br/>Yet they stand far away, making a fuss.<br/>But what, exactly, are they waiting for?<br/>We are cornered. They couldn&#39;t ask for more.<br/>Is this person – the girl I have just met,<br/>Something quite special, causing them to fret?&quot;</p><p>While I mulled over that interesting thought,<br/>The monsters began to chant, the whole lot.<br/>&quot;That magi has power for us to take!<br/>Now is the time. We all know what&#39;s at stake!<br/>She&#39;s a young fledgling away from her flock.<br/>Her wings will soon sprout. We must race the clock!&quot;</p><p>Then there was a roar, deafening in size,<br/>The shadows all grew and began to rise,<br/>In moments they launched together as one,<br/>Nefarious creatures all on the run.<br/>They were ravage – savage – yet filled with glee.<br/>They were stretching, coiling, limping at me.<br/>That moment I knew there was no way out,<br/>So I turned to my friend and gave a shout.<br/>&quot;Hey, listen. You really are a stranger,<br/>Yet even so, I don&#39;t want you in danger.<br/>If you can hear me while wrapped in that cloak,<br/>Do something. Anything. Give me a poke.&quot;</p><p>At this point her aura had grown so bright,<br/>My eyes could not focus on all the light.<br/>Yet I then felt something touch my left hand,<br/>I seemed to reach her in some distant land.<br/>Her fingers quickly entertwined with mine.<br/>It was calming for me. <em>We might be fine</em>.<br/>From our palms appeared a small orb of light.<br/>It quickly grew into a shield of white.<br/>Soon we were covered by spherical glass.<br/>It extended far out into the grass.<br/>It was opaque, blocking everything else.<br/>*I guess we are stuck until the frost melts.&quot;</p><p>Just moments before, I was filled with dread.<br/>I really thought we were soon to be dead.<br/>Yet there in the bubble, the world was still.<br/>I just felt nothing. No goodness or ill.<br/>It was me and my friend. There all alone.<br/>We were together to fight the unknown.<br/>Though she no longer shone, she was asleep.<br/>Her clothes had vanished. I felt like a creep.<br/>I then looked away with an awkward cough.<br/><em>There&#39;s something about this that feels so off.<br/>I might be in a place I shouldn&#39;t be.<br/>I need to think about how to get free.</em></p><p>There in that moment, I heard a strange thump.<br/><em>A beat from my heart that caused me to jump?<br/>No. That&#39;s impossible. It makes no sense.<br/>The noise was too loud. Way too intense.</em><br/>I then saw a smudge against the sphere&#39;s edge.<br/>I took a deep breath and muttered a pledge,<br/>&quot;We&#39;ve gotten pretty stuck here, you and me.<br/>Yet we need each other, as you can see.<br/>By some miracle, you saved us just now.<br/>So I&#39;ll save us too in someway somehow.<br/>Like I said, I&#39;ll do whatever it takes.<br/>We need to tread lightly. Make no mistakes.&quot;</p><p>Again a thump. Another. Another.<br/>My lungs began to suffocate. Smother.<br/>With every beat came another small smear,<br/>Each one revealing the night so clear.<br/>Every smudge was a hand. A paw. A claw.<br/>All windows outside to a scene so raw.<br/>The horde had closed in. I heard muffled cries.<br/>They were swarming around like hungry flies.<br/> With a thump came the stars. Another, land.<br/>I saw an odd something next to the sand.<br/>A body – my body – with clothes to match,<br/>It lay on the ground with hardly a scratch.<br/>It was still obscured by the sphere&#39;s white shell,<br/>But how it was there, I could hardly tell.<br/><em>This must be a trick. A devious plot.<br/>An illusion to have one of us caught.</em><br/>From where I was, I couldn&#39;t see it&#39;s face.<br/>I shouldn&#39;t have looked, no matter the case.<br/>And yet, intrigued, I took a step forward.<br/>Still with my friend&#39;s hand, I tugged her toward.<br/>She wouldn&#39;t budge and her grip was quite strong.<br/>As I looked outside, I saw something wrong.<br/>A head on my body, looking at me.<br/>Yet it wasn&#39;t my face. It couldn&#39;t be.<br/>It&#39;s eyes were deep blue. It&#39;s hair was jet black.<br/>I couldn&#39;t help but be taken aback.<br/>I shrieked and watched as it mimicked my fall.<br/>The reflection was hers. Not mine at all.<br/>I looked to my friend. She was not awake.<br/><em>Get it together. You know what&#39;s at stake!</em></p><p>Suddenly, there was a new thump and smear.<br/>A claw that made another face appear.<br/>One that I knew, but still hadn&#39;t seen.<br/>It was of my creature, gruesome and mean.<br/>It&#39;s eyes glowed red. It wore a toothy grin.<br/>Black liquid oozed from the tip of it&#39;s chin.<br/>And yet it paused while looking at us both,<br/>It&#39;s brows furrowed before shouting an oath.<br/>&quot;Here we are many and you are alone.<br/>It doesn&#39;t matter if you have a clone.<br/>This shield will break, and then we will win.<br/>We will rip you to shreds once we are in.&quot;</p><p>It then roared and shouted, looking away,<br/>It took a step back and began to say,<br/>&quot;Ignore the corpse. Go straight for the girl.<br/>She&#39;s who we&#39;re after. Our present. Our pearl.<br/>We are almost there. The egg will soon break!<br/> Ignore that other one. Go for the girl.<br/></p><p>This face I knew, but it still wasn&#39;t mine.<br/></p><p>So rather than move, I craned my neck long.<br/>I tried and I tried, I still couldn&#39;t see.<br/>I wriggled, jiggled, but couldn&#39;t get free.</p><p>I saw something wrong...</p><p>A body distinct from the ugly lot,<br/> He looks towards a still opaque part of the bubble and sees reflection of Anne. The hand then smears off the paint, revealing his face and then the face of his creature.</p><p>&quot;This bubble she&#39;s in is just a disguise!<br/></p><p>I controlled my breathing and took a step.<br/> I mustered my courage and took a step.<br/></p><p>He walks towards the glass, but is held back. He feels the dirt against his feet. Another thump.</p><p>My eyes were adjusting I saw it outside. Something disgusting. The horde had closed in and stood just outside.<br/> from the glass, a disconcerting sound.<br/>A thump from a creatures mighty pound.</p><p>A rumble. A mumble. A muffled cry, &quot;We were too late, but we can still win!&quot;</p><p>I&#39;m invading somewhere I shouldn&#39;t be.</p><p>The thump / heartbeat. The message from &quot;god&quot; Maybe her memories appear on the surface of the bubble?</p><p>he gets used to the bubble and can see outside. There&#39;s a body there that he identifies as his. He sees his reflection and doesn&#39;t see himself. Arrow.</p><p>Looking around, I saw my friend again.<br/>o</p><p>I saw a person reflected in the glass. Yet it wasn&#39;t my face, but hers.</p><p>Though blinding at first, my eyes adjusted,<br/>When looking out, I became disgusted.</p><p>o</p><p>But then I felt nothing. No fear. No hope.</p><p>Just a moment before, </p><p>A bubble appeared as an orb of light shield of white,<br/> Charge. Bubble (sbh – muffled cries from the creatures outside). Star. Arrow (misunderstood as a threat).</p><p>Yet in that moment, a bubble appeared,<br/></p><p>My only companion, .... Frantic and confused, I turned toward my friend,<br/></p><p>The creature had soon drawn a heinnous crowd.<br/> My friend&#39;s light condensed to a single point,<br/>My friend&#39;s light dimmed, she became a cacoon,<br/></p><p>&quot;No. We can make it. We just need to go!<br/></p><p>&quot;This is it. We&#39;ve been found. We can&#39;t escape.<br/>shape...</p><p>She did not move. She was rooted in place,<br/>I could not overcome the fear on her face.</p><p>We could not run. She would give us away,<br/> We huffed and we puffed and we ran away.<br/> At this point, her aura had grown so bright,<br/>So much that it nearly blinded my sight.<br/> I leapt into action, grabbing my friend,</p><p>A flight yet fight</p><p>against better judgement, I followed instinct.<br/>My body ran towards her on pure instinct.<br/> Adrenaline surging, I perked my ears.<br/>Listening closely for another&#39;s tears.<br/></p><p>My body then moved without second thought.<br/>Split second to chase after her.<br/></p><ol><li>Arrow pierces the heart while fleeing from the creature</li><li>Hes still dead</li><li>He finds Anne</li></ol><p>What were these things that were haunting me so?<br/>I could not tell. I decided to go.<br/>I didn&#39;t know where. I didn&#39;t know why.<br/>I was soon out in the open night sky.<br/>I took my knife. My gun. My trusty coat.<br/>But honestly, there was nothing to note.<br/>No more shadows, smudges. Nothing to see.<br/>Nothing to figure out what these could be.</p><p>Then next to the moon, a saw a bright light. It looked like a blue star caught in mid flight. I watched it for a bit. It grew and grew. It&#39;s light unveiled this horrid black goo. Ghastly creatures wandering all around. I guess I had luck. I had not been found.</p><p>I then fell back in fear with a shout.</p><p>The being then unfurled </p><p>Maybe a nightmare. I felt quite dismayed. My mind conjured  at whatever my </p><p>The pondering made my eyes grow heavy.</p><p>A tenticle? No. Not in broad daylight. A Maybe a plant? A cloth? A  A kite?</p><p>Hoping that again it could be caught. I was wrong. I didn&#39;t see it again.</p><p>No way I&#39;d return to being a man.</p></article><nav class="docs-footer"><p class="footer-message">Powered by <a href="https://github.com/JuliaDocs/Documenter.jl">Documenter.jl</a> and the <a href="https://julialang.org/">Julia Programming Language</a>.</p></nav></div><div class="modal" id="documenter-settings"><div class="modal-background"></div><div class="modal-card"><header class="modal-card-head"><p class="modal-card-title">Settings</p><button class="delete"></button></header><section class="modal-card-body"><p><label class="label">Theme</label><div class="select"><select id="documenter-themepicker"><option value="auto">Automatic (OS)</option><option value="documenter-light">documenter-light</option><option value="documenter-dark">documenter-dark</option><option value="catppuccin-latte">catppuccin-latte</option><option value="catppuccin-frappe">catppuccin-frappe</option><option value="catppuccin-macchiato">catppuccin-macchiato</option><option value="catppuccin-mocha">catppuccin-mocha</option></select></div></p><hr/><p>This document was generated with <a href="https://github.com/JuliaDocs/Documenter.jl">Documenter.jl</a> version 1.11.4 on <span class="colophon-date" title="Friday 16 May 2025 10:51">Friday 16 May 2025</span>.
