href="#The-Things-I-Can&#39;t-See" title="Permalink"></a></h1><p>Once I was out and about at midday –<br/>Absolutely normal in every way,<br/>But across a short alleyway, there was a niggle.<br/>A tendril. An arm thing? A little black wriggle.<br/>I can not describe it, except that I blinked,<br/>After that it was gone. Just completely extinct.<br/>So I sat there and thought, and I thought, and I thought.<br/>All while hoping to find some great myst&#39;ry I sought.<br/>But it never came back. Well, at least not for me.<br/>While in bed, I did think about what it could be.<br/>But eventually I became overtaken.<br/>I dreamt an odd dream. I don&#39;t think I&#39;m mistaken.</p><p>Across my small room, I saw shadows – a creature!<br/>I could not quite tell each and every feature.<br/>A man who was hunched right against the far wall?<br/>A few kids? An old lass? Someone naturally small?<br/>It began a strange dance as it flickered around,<br/>Little hops left and right without making a sound.<br/>Very soon I was frozen by unnatural fear,<br/>And became quite alarmed as the object drew near.<br/>In an instant, it vanished, becoming a smudge.<br/>I then shouted while giving my lamp a quick nudge.<br/>In the light it was gone, like the alley before.<br/>For that night I was done. I could handle no more.</p><p>So I ran down the stairs and I turned on the TV.<br/>Just hoping that shadowy thing wouldn&#39;t see me.<br/>It worked, I suppose because hours flew by.<br/>To be frank, I was scared and I thought I would cry.<br/>Soon the screen turned to static. The windows were dark.<br/>I just kept looking out toward a large local park.<br/>As I stared all too deeply right into the void.<br/>All my senses were sharpened. I felt paranoid.<br/>&quot;There is nothing. There&#39;s nothing.&quot; I said to myself,<br/>Then a figure appeared. It was next to my shelf.<br/>It was large. It was dark. It was human in form.<br/>At the time my heart stopped and my face felt quite warm.<br/>It took all of my power to hold back a scream.<br/>&quot;It&#39;s a dream.&quot; I repeated. &quot;A dream. It&#39;s a dream!&quot;</p><p>Then emboldened by logic, I took a quick stand,<br/>I approached it with small, awkward waves of my hand,<br/>But I stepped on a creak and it whipped right around.<br/>All my courage then left me and could not be found.<br/>In that moment, my body and soul seemed to split,<br/>All too strangely my eyes could not focus on it.<br/>It was faceless, opaque, with a glob for a head,<br/>It then gurgled (or howled?) while pulsing and said,<br/>&quot;Little human, you&#39;re not the right person I seek.<br/>But unfortunately, your near future is bleak.<br/>Only those with some power see me and my kin.<br/>You have no idea what kind of trouble you&#39;re in.&quot;</p><p>It then lurched and unfurled while limping at me,<br/>With new tenticles reaching like roots on a tree.<br/>In a panic, I screached all while toppling my chair,<br/>I then ran. But to where? Well, I tried not to care.<br/>Soon the floor felt like sand, and the walls were too small.<br/>I then launched for the door just beyond a short hall.<br/>I felt shortness of breath while I jiggled the knob.<br/>Everything was in silence, except my heart throb.<br/>Whether seconds or hours had passed, I lost track,<br/>But the door soon revealed a world, pitch black.<br/>No recourse. I then fled to the darkness&#39; embrace,<br/>Behind me, a deep shout, &quot;I enjoy a good race!&quot;</p><p>Ev&#39;ry step. Ev&#39;ry breath. Ev&#39;ry beat of my heart.<br/>I felt hot molten lava through my ev&#39;ry part.<br/>I was frantic, brain static. All thinking was hard,<br/>But I said to myself that I know my own yard.<br/>&quot;I&#39;ll just get to the park and then call for some help.&quot;<br/>But when looking straight forward, I let out a yelp.<br/>On the bound&#39;ry between swaying grass and night sky,<br/>I saw something odd moving that felt quite awry.<br/>At first glance, it appeared as peculiar rubble,<br/>Amorphous black goop with a weirdly shaped bubble.<br/>Again and again some more bubbles appeared.<br/>Ev&#39;ry one of them creatures. Far worse than I feared.<br/>Yet I could not retreat now, no matter the cost.<br/>For my home – no my sanctuary was now lost.<br/>As I curved through some trees, I heard something behind,<br/>From my house, a loud thunder from one of their kind:<br/>&quot;My dear brothers, don&#39;t hunt! I will have my own fun,<br/>For tonight we shall feast. You must wait &#39;till I&#39;m done!&quot;</p><p>Soon a crack and a cackle erupted around,<br/>It was cruel. A chaotic, cacophonous sound.<br/>All the shadows then vanished as if in assent.<br/>In that instant, I knew what the noise must have meant:<br/>That the creature – my creature had left me his mark.<br/>He would hunt me alone, so my future was stark.<br/>All too soon there was nothing. No voices. No light.<br/>I just had to keep running with no way to fight.<br/>There was rustling and howling with noise all around,<br/>Yet it all felt so distant, as if I had drowned.<br/>With dispair in the air, I let fear take the lead,<br/>Every movement was primal, I would not concede!<br/>*I just have to survive.** That was all I could think,<br/>So I kept clawing forward or else I would sink.</p><p>Then from deep in the forest, a whisper. A pout?<br/>It was simple and soft, yet as loud as a shout.<br/>It had caused me to jump and break out of my trance,<br/>So I swiveled while running in some sort of dance.<br/>I kept trying to locate the sound that I heard.<br/>There was no one. I thought, &quot;Look, this is absurd!<br/>Why would anyone else be around? It&#39;s so late.<br/>But then maybe this meeting means more... It is fate.&quot;</p><p>I then heard it again. A short plea so distinct,<br/>That my body leapt forward and followed instinct.<br/>I then ducked through some branches and weaved through the trees.<br/>I was still being stalked so I didn&#39;t dare freeze.<br/>Then a clearing appeared with a bench and a slide,<br/>And what looked like a figure, just sitting beside.<br/>I then paused, breathing hard. <em>What if this is a trap?</em><br/>There was no time to think, so I gave her a tap.<br/>She then leapt all while crying and crawling away,<br/>&quot;Please don&#39;t hunt me. I just want to live through the day.&quot;<br/> So I knelt down and whispered, &quot;Hey, wait. I&#39;m a friend.<br/>Please just come with me now so we don&#39;t meet our end.&quot;</p><p>She then looked right at me, her face painted in fear.<br/>She was frozen while thinking and let me draw near.<br/>It was dark at the time and I couldn&#39;t see much.<br/>There was something about her that gave me a hunch.<br/>A strange feeling I felt way deep down in my core.<br/>So I then had to ask, &quot;Have I met you before?&quot;</p><p>Though in imminent danger, the world seemed to stop.<br/>We just studied each other from bottom to top.<br/>She had eyes of deep blue and her hair was light brown,<br/>At the time, she had pursed her lips into a frown.<br/>Yet her juxtaposition was truly a sight.<br/>She appeared as an angel amid a dark night.<br/>As I looked even longer, my vision soon blurred,<br/>Like my brain turned to goo while my thoughts were all stirred.</p><p>In a flash, my head split and my body collapsed.<br/>There is no way to know how much time had elapsed.<br/>I awoke to her tear sliding down my right cheek,<br/>With my head in her lap. She said, &quot;This looks quite bleak,<br/>We&#39;ll get through this somehow. We just have to. We will.<br/>Please just calm down. Relax. We&#39;ll stay silent. Be still.&quot;</p><p>In that moment, her hand on my head and her voice...<br/>Everything felt so calming. I made a bold choice.<br/>I said, &quot;OK. Let&#39;s do this. Let&#39;s think of a plan.<br/>I will promise to do anything that I can.&quot;<br/>I then saw something odd. A faint aura? A glow?<br/>A translucent white mist that continued to grow,<br/>And then covered her body from head to her toe,<br/>Quite perplexed, I then asked, &quot;What is that? Do you know?&quot;</p><div class="admonition is-info" id="AAAA-6ceccff0dee6178b"><header class="admonition-header">AAAA<a class="admonition-anchor" href="#AAAA-6ceccff0dee6178b" title="Permalink"></a></header><div class="admonition-body"><p>Doublet doublet: Glow, grow, Toe, Know. Fix Glow and Grow if possible because they are used later</p></div></div><p>&quot;What is what?&quot; she responded, as if unaware.</p><p>I said, &quot;Maybe it&#39;s nothing&quot; and tried not to stare.<br/>But it irked me quite deeply. I started to wonder,<br/>If talking to her was a possible blunder.<br/>I didn&#39;t know her, and she didn&#39;t know me.<br/>In the end, we were strange as two strangers could be.<br/>Yet that strangeness bred closeness. I felt a connection.<br/>She pointed. No question. I followed direction.<br/>We crawled a short distance right into a playhouse,<br/>Collectively sighed, slightly sheltered from chaos.</p><p>We whispered and analyzed our situation.<br/>It wasn&#39;t too long until her short narration.<br/>&quot;It knows where we are. We can&#39;t hide. We can&#39;t fight.<br/>So to me, our best option has got to be flight.<br/>We must run and keep running as fast as we can.<br/>But it could come from anywhere. We need a plan.<br/>There is something I think we both know to be true,<br/>That we cannot get caught. It wants me. It wants you.&quot;</p><p>At that moment, we paused and both thought the same thought.<br/>Were the creatures we ran from the same? Maybe not?<br/>And if not, then just how many creatures were there?<br/>At that moment I noticed her gaze. A deep stare.<br/>It went right past my eyes and straight into my soul.<br/>All her aura extinguished and now just a coal.<br/>We could run from just one. Maybe two, but not more.<br/>Yet we knew there were many. We heard them before.<br/>So we sat there in silence both shoulder to shoulder.<br/>No plans left to plan. We got colder and colder.</p><p>The moment of respite was quickly destroyed,<br/>For from deep in the forest, a voice quite annoyed,<br/>&quot;You can&#39;t hide for much longer. I know you are here.<br/>Who is that you are with? A pair huddled in fear...<br/>It&#39;s no matter for me. Just one more for the feast.<br/>She does look to be tasty – a snack at the least!&quot;<br/>I then saw it appear from the edge of the park,<br/>An odd smudge. A long shadow. A figure, quite dark.<br/>Now distorted, opaque, and much larger in size,<br/>It was cutting through silence with gutteral cries.</p><p>So I looked toward my friend and then tugged on her hand.<br/>I said, &quot;Come with me. Right now, I need you to stand.<br/>We have no time to think. We have no time to rest.<br/>We&#39;ll get through this together. Our final grand test.&quot;</p><p>She was still and unmoving. I pulled and I pulled,<br/>But her paralyzed glare was both icy and cold.<br/>She said, &quot;Hey. There&#39;s no doubt that we&#39;re hopeless and late.<br/>Maybe now it is time to accept our grim fate.&quot;<br/>She then stared at the creature, now so very close.<br/>We could see it quite clearly, all gooey and gross.<br/>Its new body was buldging with odd extra legs,<br/>And it smelled truly awful, like old rotten eggs.<br/>As I studied it close, I saw more than before.<br/>Its translucent, dark skin showed a red glowing core.</p><p>All my thoughts seemed to scatter. I lost my own mind.<br/>I then sought an escape. Any help I could find.<br/>Yet my eyes could not focus on any one thing,<br/>Time had frozen and panic then reigned as my king.<br/>So with little recourse, I just stared at the sky.<br/>With my heart indicating the time passing by.<br/>I was drowning on shore with the waves hitting me,<br/>So I offered the heavens a desperate plea:<br/>&quot;To a god or a goddess who&#39;s up there right now,<br/>We could really use help in some way or somehow.<br/>I don&#39;t know what we want – What we need at our core.<br/>For it might be a miracle... Or something more!<br/>If you hear me right now, please just send us your best,<br/>Maybe give me a plan and I&#39;ll do all the rest!&quot;</p><p>There are bound&#39;ries where subjective, objective smear,<br/>Where fantastical facts and good stories appear.<br/>It was there that I think that our story began.<br/>As a promise to no one to do what we can.</p><p>The next moment, I saw a star shimmer and glow.<br/>It just rocked back and forth before starting to grow.<br/>It then pulsed a bright blue and popped with a sound.<br/>A lone note in the emptiness, echoing &#39;round.<br/>In a chain reaction, there were more stars to burst.<br/>Ev&#39;ry one with a vibrant display, like the first.<br/>Pretty soon there was no light. The sky was pitch black.<br/>We saw only our creature&#39;s dim, red glowing sack.</p><p>It had stopped in the darkness while watching and curious,<br/>Its miserable core both impatient and furious.<br/>It felt like a cat watching prey get away.<br/>Or a shark smelling blood, watching dinner decay.<br/>Under cover of darkness, I checked on my friend.<br/>Even then, she was whispering, &quot;This is the end.&quot;<br/>In that moment, I felt something deep in my soul.<br/>That my hope to survive was alive – a small coal.<br/>I could save myself only. My partner was stone.<br/>In the void I could run and escape all alone,<br/>Yet my heart knew the truth. That there wasn&#39;t a choice.<br/>I then squeezed her hand tightly while raising my voice,<br/>&quot;We are in this together. I&#39;ll die by your side.&quot;<br/>Then my coal was snuffed out while we silently cried.</p><p>The faint light from the creature – now all we could see,<br/>Though once chained to the earth was released and set free.<br/>The false idol stepped forward, and as it did so,<br/>A red shockwave then set the void briefly aglow.<br/>A new step. A new gust. A new wave on the sand,<br/>We felt pressure now building we could not withstand.<br/>Something new then appeared. A faint light from behind.<br/>From the heart of my friend that each pulse then refined.</p><div class="admonition is-info" id="What&#39;s-left-5a56710edaf23976"><header class="admonition-header">What&#39;s left<a class="admonition-anchor" href="#What&#39;s-left-5a56710edaf23976" title="Permalink"></a></header><div class="admonition-body"><ol><li>Anne is going to develop powers</li><li>Belle will accidentally steal the powers</li><li>They run</li></ol></div></div></article><nav class="docs-footer"><a class="docs-footer-prevpage" href="../intro/">« Introduction</a><div class="flexbox-break"></div><p class="footer-message">Powered by <a href="https://github.com/JuliaDocs/Documenter.jl">Documenter.jl</a> and the <a href="https://julialang.org/">Julia Programming Language</a>.</p></nav></div><div class="modal" id="documenter-settings"><div class="modal-background"></div><div class="modal-card"><header class="modal-card-head"><p class="modal-card-title">Settings</p><button class="delete"></button></header><section class="modal-card-body"><p><label class="label">Theme</label><div class="select"><select id="documenter-themepicker"><option value="auto">Automatic (OS)</option><option value="documenter-light">documenter-light</option><option value="documenter-dark">documenter-dark</option><option value="catppuccin-latte">catppuccin-latte</option><option value="catppuccin-frappe">catppuccin-frappe</option><option value="catppuccin-macchiato">catppuccin-macchiato</option><option value="catppuccin-mocha">catppuccin-mocha</option></select></div></p><hr/><p>This document was generated with <a href="https://github.com/JuliaDocs/Documenter.jl">Documenter.jl</a> version 1.11.4 on <span class="colophon-date" title="Friday 16 May 2025 10:51">Friday 16 May 2025</span>.
