# My Reflection Is Not Mine

When I look in the mirror, I see my reflection.
Blue eyes. Brown hair. A nose that is simultaneously too big and too small.
When it smiles, so do I.

It can be cool or cute.\
Timid or brave.\
Happy or sad.

Yet when I look in the mirror, I do not see myself.
Rather, I see a reflection of everyone else.
I am trapped, forced to act as a puppet to people pulling my strings:\
My family.\
My friends.\
Random strangers I catch glimpses of on the train.

Every other person has more power over my reflection than I do.

Yet this is not the story of my reflection.
It is a story of me.

It is about time I pick up a pen and write.
